# Project Proposal by Caner Gursel

###What was it Felt Like to be in There?

####Introduction
The project I want to do is creating a website which will allow people to upload their *viewpoints* from historical events they take part of. Therefore, anyone who has an omnidirectional camera, a camera that can take 360-degree pictures and videos, would be able to upload their personal experiences from events that have the possibility to be considered as historical events in the future.

For example, a person who was at Damascus in the night of US’ military attack towards the Syrian Government could have the opportunity to share what she was experiencing at the exact moment of the air strike. Additionally, uploaders would also have the chance to share their experiences orally, through the voice notes that they record during or after the events. Their oral comments will maintain multiple dimensions to their experiences by fulfilling their visual experiences with how they feel during the events and how they evaluate the experiences they were part of.

Once an omnidirectional footage is submitted to the website, its authenticity will be reviewed and after being approved will be available to anyone with a virtual reality headset to experience the first-person point of view of the events taking place. The footage will be accompanied by recordings from multiple timelines and will include brief summaries of their historical background available online. A user will have the opportunity to see from the eyes of the person experiencing *history in the making*, to listen to the same sounds and to learn about the ultimate historical narrative that the experience was part of. If we can get various uploads of the same event, we will also have the opportunity to demonstrate the same historical events from different perspectives. As a consequence, the project that I request to get funding for will create a lively historical platform that connects personal experiences to one another by transforming them into easily accessible primary sources. The transformation of the personal experiences to the historical primary sources will also transform the traditional comprehension of the historical primary resources as we know of.

In the project, numerous Digital History methods will be used. First, the  360-degree footage from uploaders will maintain the spatial dimension; therefore the project will count as a spatial history resource on its own. Nevertheless, there will also be an option to see a map that is centered upon the viewpoint of the uploader. In the case of the uploader from Damascus, there would be markers that illustrate the intended targets of the air strikes, and other markers that illustrate the places that those strikes damaged, giving relevance to the visual experience. The voice recordings of the uploader will count as oral history sources. However, the most critical aspect of this project will be the possibility of it being a new Digital History method. Because of the crucial benefits that this project promise, I am requesting the *Large Grant* to develop an entirely functioning web-based database of omnidirectional footage of historic moments to be made available to everyone free of charge. The website aims to transmit the experience of the moment as much as possible; therefore, it needs to be developed by experts who would need the resources they need available to them in order to deliver this pivotal project.

####Methods

#####The Research Plan and the Dissemination of the Results:

Firstly, I will need an office space to run weekly meetings, and work as organized as possible. Additionally, I will need to get technical tools such as computers to work on, and omnidirectional camera equipment for my video crew. The website will be central to our project. The website will be a member-based for using it as a source. Upon registration, there would be a tutorial about using the website properly. Nevertheless, uploaders will not need to be members and not need to go through the registration process, due to the momentary circumstances they are part of. The data that they upload will be reviewed by our team, and then were allowed if our team would consider them as historically adequate primary sources. Thereafter, we will collect data that we got from approved uploads, and then our research assistants will work on the markers of the map, audio player/s and writing the summary of the historical background that the shared experience is affiliated. In the end, my colleague and I will examine the outcomes of the work of our research assistants and will upload them if we think those outcomes are adequate.

After the completion of the website, we will only need to get more footage from uploaders. Our project depends on uploaders providing footage; therefore, we will not need to do any preliminary research per se. Nevertheless, our user dependency is our first challenge to overcome. We will work with a video crew who have sufficient technical equipment and knowledge. I will send this crew to multiple events that my colleague and I will count as being potentially historically significant. The pitfall is the inductive reasoning that we have to use in deciding for historical events beforehand. It is a counterintuitive way of analyzing history, but I think we will get satisfactory results from some of the experiences that our crew will gather.

The next challenge we will encounter will be getting an adequate number of uploads and members. For getting uploads, we will work with a communications team. They will advertise our project through social media platforms. I think we will get pictures at first, because of the difficulties of recording 360-degree videos. Along with the technical advancements, I am certain that we will also get enough videos from uploaders to work on. Nevertheless, getting an abundance of data will lead to another challenge for us. Along with the increased number of uploads, filtering historically adequate experiences will become harder. Until a point, my colleague and I will work on the filtering processes, but if we encounter a drastic increase in the number of uploads, we will need to hire an extra historian to work for us in filtering results.

The major challenge will be finding members. Firstly, my colleague and I will do presentations to the major libraries that contain VR headsets. Other than institutions, it will be a challenge to reach a satisfactory user number in the short term. The VR technology is relatively new; therefore, they are relatively expensive. Yet, I believe that its price will drop down in the recent future; and we will be able to reach a wide audience in a couple of years.

We will disseminate the results through our open source web database. Because of the service, we will do, creating a medium for people to share their historical experiences; we will need to run through a member-based system, in order to prevent unwanted outcomes. Membership will be free though, to maintain the essence of the concept of being accessible.

#####The User Experience:
The home page’s layout will only display sections from the pictures or videos that are uploaded. The titles of those sections will be displayed when users will hover over the sections. Those titles will be displayed chronologically. There will also be an option to see those sections above the world map in order to emphasize the importance of the spatial aspect of the experiences. After clicking a section, users will need to connect their VR headsets. If we will contain multiple uploads of the same event, there will also be a pop-up window for them to choose one of the experiences of the event. Relevant to the data that we will get from uploaders, users will lead to an interactive 360-degree picture or a 360-degree video. They will be able to experience the momentary experiences of uploaders as many times as they want.

The map, the voice recordings and the summary of the text will be displayed by choice. From their VR controller, they will be able to choose what they want to experience besides the *experience* that they are *in*. The map will be centralized from the viewpoint, and it will show the relevant places to that experience. The voice notes will ideally be twofold: One during the event, and one after the event. Users will want to listen to them whenever they want during their *experiences*. The summary will be narrated and written by our research assistants. Users will have the opportunity to listen or to read them. After they finish their *experiences*, they will have the option of going into the next experience that is about the same event.   

####Timeline

The project would finish approximately in a year from April 2019, around May 2020. Nevertheless, it is intended to be an ongoing project.  First, I will hire a Toronto based historian who has an adequate technical understanding of the project. In the upcoming month, we will hire two history graduate students as research assistants from Toronto, who have sufficient technical skills, such as web development, and coding. Then, I will hire two software engineers, who will design the website. The design processes will be approximately six months. At the same time, I will hire a video crew with at least three members and will send them to events that my colleague and I will determine as historically promising. In the course of these six months, we will get enough footage from our video crew to start our project. After we get our preliminary data, our research assistants will research about the historical backgrounds of these events.

When we have the beta version of the website, I will hire a communications team and will make them responsible for the advertisement of our website. Even though we will have a video crew, our aim will especially be to get data from individuals all around the world. To achieve our aim, we will have to work with experts in the field to attract as many uploaders and users as possible. Meantime, my colleague and I will attend conferences, and go to various universities and make presentations in order to request historians and libraries to contribute to our project by sharing their databases or using our database for their future work.  

After the web developers finish the website, around October 2019, they will start to work on videos and pictures by converting them to VR adequate format. They will be in charge with all of the technical aspects of the videos and pictures that will be uploaded to our website. Until we reach an adequate number of uploads, we will work with our video crew, and send them to various other events in North and South America. If we get extra funding by that time from private investors or other educational institutes, we would have the option of sending them anywhere around the world. As I stated above, my colleague and I will determine which uploads would be historically significant, and our research assistants will work on adjusting uploaded personal experiences to our format. After our examinations, we will be ready to deliver a web-based medium that preserves experience based primary resources. Around April 2019 we will have enough primary sources to be considered as an important historical database and will hopefully get extra funding to continue our project.

####Importance

In *What is it like to be a bat?*[Nagel](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/activities/modules/ugmodules/humananimalstudies/lectures/32/nagel_bat.pdf), Thomas Nagel defines the experience, hence as *there is something it is like to be in that state*; and argues that in the light of current ontology, it is impossible to derive a more comprehensive, objective, definition of the experience than the one that he proposes. The problem of defining experience illustrates the tension between the objectivity and subjectivity.  Objectivity is regarded “as founding myth” of the history by defining history with the “fixity of the past”, thus, creating a “sharp separation between subject & object”[Price](https://digitalhistory.github.io/dh-website/slides/10-oral-history/#/slide-objectivity-as-founding-myth-c350). Yet, along with the digital history methods such as oral history the objectivity of the history has challenged. Those methods put subjective experiences in the center of the historical accounts, such as the project that I propose.

Our project will retain the personal experiences by illustrating the *what was it like to be in there* aspect of historical events. The multidimensional historical experience that we aim to provide will reiterate the importance of subjective experiences for the comprehension of history. Consequently, the retained significance of the subjective experiences will bolster the transformation process of the objectivized static history to a dynamic enterprise that is constructed upon various perspectives. This shift in the comprehension of the framework of history will also shake the truth-value of historical events, hence, will force our community to change their fact and belief dichotomy.

Connectedly, the acknowledgment of the historical value of the subjective experiences will initiate the possibility of newly emerging primary sources that are unknown of at present. Oral history started to count personal stories as primary resources. Nevertheless, oral history sources fail to deliver a multidimensional experience due to concentrating on just one side of the story. The project that I propose aims to fulfill those historical experiences by providing the visual aspects as well. By re-visualizing historical experiences, ideally, from as many perspectives as possible, we will provide fresh primary sources that will exponentially increase along with the success of the project. Along with the technological improvements, other projects would have the opportunity to exceed what we will establish and would come up with new ways to fulfill historical experiences.

The project promises various other benefits for shifting the historical understanding of our communities. Citizens would have the opportunity to share their experiences not just as experiences per se, but also as historical narratives. The twofold consequences of our project to public sphere will be enormous. First, people will understand their positions in the history, hence, their importance for the history in the making. They will begin to see them as historical subjects who have an opportunity to change the course of history. Second, this perception of themselves as historical subjects will lead to a shift in their understanding of the history itself. They will easily comprehend that history is in fact not necessarily an enterprise of the past, but of the present as well. Their understanding of the past from present and their role of historical subjects in the history in the making would compel them to weight the consequences of their present actions that will be considered as historically significant in the future.
