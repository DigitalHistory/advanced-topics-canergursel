Pink Floyd has always been more than a music band due to the vision of its cofounder, Roger Waters. Waters used literary and political concepts in his lyrics, and combined the issues that he was interested in with the musical and thematic geniuses of Pink Floyd’s other contributors. His masterpiece is considered as *The Wall*, “a rock opera” about the metaphorical walls that people are forced to maintain in their daily lives. [Scarfe, 57](http://www.geraldscarfe.com/shop/books/the-making-of-pink-floyd-the-wall-paperback-version/)  As a consequence, it was not surprising when he took action against Israel’s occupation of Palestine and the wall that Israel had constructed in order to maintain its security. <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(3)"> seek to 0:3 </a> [Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/terrorism/palestinian/pages/saving%20lives-%20israel-s%20anti-terrorist%20fence%20-%20answ.aspx#1).  In this short essay, I will briefly fill the historical background of the Israeli wall that Waters’ interview in *The Huffington Post* lacks, and then clarify the differing morality of constructing that wall. Finally, I will explain how oral history sources would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the history.

Israel has occupied the Palestinian territories since *the Six Days War of 1967*, in which the Israel army conquered the territory held by Jordan Egypt and Syria .[Holmila, 103](http://heinonline.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/nordic74&page=103&collection=journals)  From then on, Israel administered the occupied territories of Gaza (till Hamas took the control in 2007) and West Bank, and annexed East Jerusalem in its jurisdiction and administration .[Stewart, 221](https://books.google.ca/books?id=JYE2eOEmwmkC&pg=PA223&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) In 2002, due to the growing violent conflicts between Palestinians, who had performed terrorist attacks in Jewish settled communities, and Israeli Jews, Israel government decided “to build a separation wall between Israel and Palestine”  <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(75)"> seek to 1:15</a>.[Holmila, 103](http://heinonline.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/nordic74&page=103&collection=journals).  The General Assembly of the United Nations had condemned the construction and existence of a separation wall, and the International Court of Justice decided that the wall “violated international law”.[International Court of Justice](https://web.archive.org/web/20040902090629/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/ipresscom/ipress2004/ipresscom2004-28_mwp_20040709.htm) Nevertheless, Israel denied ICJ’s decision by rendering the legality of the separation wall for the sake of the safety of the Jewish population in Israel.

Israeli Government provides data about its “Anti-terrorist Fence” in the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs website with the header called  “Saving Lives …” . [Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/terrorism/palestinian/pages/saving%20lives-%20israel-s%20anti-terrorist%20fence%20-%20answ.aspx#3) In Jewish context, it is pretty clear that this wall is a functional tool that serves for the greater good. Yet, scholarly sources beg to differ. Shaul E. Cohen argues that even though this wall, *fence* in Jewish context, impedes suicide bombers of Palestinian radical groups to reach their goal, it eventually  “harms the peace process and stimulates terrorism” in the long run. He provides data that demonstrate the readiness of Israelis to give up the wall for the sake of peace.  Moreover, he concludes by asserting the fact that the Israeli occupation’s “contribution to an ongoing state of war. [Cohen, 694](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/details/00167428/v96i0004/682_iwbbaitp.xml)

The “territory, refugees and compensation, and the status of Jerusalem” were determined as the fundamental issues to be resolved by the United Nations in order to maintain a “just and lasting peace”. <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(128)"> seek to 2:08</a>[Stewart, 222](https://books.google.ca/books?id=JYE2eOEmwmkC&pg=PA223&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) Yet, Israeli occupation and the existence of “the racial segregation wall or apartheid wall”, which are the names attributed by Palestinians to the wall that Israel government had constructed and the current settlement building of Israel in those territories, and Israel’s resistance against the international pressure to halt its settlement program are still an impediment against the resolution of the aforementioned issues that are crucially important for the peace as Waters remarks in his interview.[Stewart , 237](https://books.google.ca/books?id=JYE2eOEmwmkC&pg=PA223&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).  

Perhaps the most interesting source that I use in this essay is another quasi-oral history source, the widely acclaimed documentary *The Gatekeepers*. The documentary is directed by Dror Moreh, who had convinced the six former heads of the Israeli secret service, Shin Bet to talk about their experiences after the Six Days War and about the politics of Israel against the Arab community in Palestine. Listening the stories of people who realize that they had to act according to their prima facie responsibilities to their own people provides subjective aspects for a deeply controversial historical topic. They clearly explain why they had to act violently towards the Palestinian terrorists, and how they feel something “unnatural” about it. <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(78)"> seek to 1:18</a>.[The Gatekeepers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2309788/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

Their overlapping conclusion of the interviewees, hence Israel’s political and military stance towards Palestinians, is the fact that they act without any strategy, a long-term plan to maintain peace, but only with tactics, short-term plans to stop terrorist attacks. They claim politicians responsible to the existing state of war that they had *directly* influenced. *The Gatekeepers* succeeds in portraying the conversion of the subjective stances of the important figures of a historical topic towards that specific historical topic.  <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(97)"> seek to 1:37</a>.  [The Gatekeepers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2309788/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

Written primary and secondary sources are enough to portray differing opinions or stances for a historical topic. But being able to listen subjective experiences, especially the subjective stances that had been influential to that historical topic, maintain layers for historians to examine. Oral history is a powerful tool against the objectified nature of the history, hence our comprehension of it as an objective study. I think an increase with historians’ affiliation with oral history, which would lead to an exponential increase in the numbers of historical figures and sources, would also provide a more comprehensive understanding for the history itself.
